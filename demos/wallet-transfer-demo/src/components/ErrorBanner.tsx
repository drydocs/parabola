/**
 * transfer() throwing does not mean nothing happened: the source-chain burn step can
 * succeed and then a later step (attestation polling, the mint call) can still fail.
 * transfer() rethrows those as a TransferError carrying burnTxHash (see src/errors.ts) --
 * recoverableBurnTxHash reflects that. Separately, an approve step's own confirmation can
 * time out before the burn is ever attempted (submissionUncertain): there's no burn hash
 * to recover with, but that transaction was still genuinely broadcast, so this banner
 * never claims "nothing happened" for that case either.

          still land on its own; check your address on the source-chain explorer if you want

          overwrite the allowance rather than accumulate.
